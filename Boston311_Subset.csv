Both N.Star and Sheerin removed the plate with the Sheerin name on it and discovered that this was an abandon work zone.

There is no record of a permit pulled at the location  in addition BWSC engineering states nobody submitted an engineering plan.    N.Star secured the plate on Sunday and then as a favor to the city back filled and paved the opening on Monday.    The CIU  will still try to find who did this work.

Replacing or repairing vaults is not an easy repair.      Eversource has to have the vaults custom made for each separate location.      This takes time.  In addition the construction itself is technical and involved  as well as expensive.     We have informed Eversource Electric that they have to set aside resources to repair vaults around the City.    The temporary repair should be done ASAP.

Closed date : 2017-01-30 08:11:46.29 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) Inspector has identified that vault on the sidewalk needing attention as the responsibility of Eversource Electric.     Replacing or repairing vaults is not an easy repair.      Eversource has to have the vaults custom made for each separate location.      This takes time.  In addition the construction itself is technical and involved  as well as expensive.     We have informed Eversource Electric that they have to set aside resources to repair vaults around the City.    The estimated time for replacement is 6-9 months.      However  we will require Eversource to make a temporary repair such as the use of asphalt  especially if it is a major tripping hazard.     The temporary repair should be done within 3 business days.     For any questions or concern  please contact the number listed below    Sincerely     Mark Cardarelli  Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance  Boston Public Works Department  617-635-4951 Office ","Sidewalk Cover / Manhole","Boston Water & Sewer Commission","Sidewalk Cover / Manhole","Sidewalk Cover / Manhole","PWDx_Contractor Complaints","PWDx","","","16-18 Kneeland St  Boston  MA  02111",4,"1C",2,"A1","Boston",4,"03","0308","16-18 Kneeland St",2111,42.351,-71.0622,"Constituent Call"
